# Features - Share your message!

- Create a custom list of sentences that you want to share with your friends and as long as you keep the option enabled, your list will be rotating automatically until you stop it.
You can also define the rotating change time limit starting from 5 seconds all up to a lot :)
- You can share your current song from Spotify with changes in real time as soon as your song updates. *Only works with the desktop application, it doesn't work with the web player.

# How to use

- Inside the game make sure you have the OSC server enabled.

If it doesn't work right away keep the OSC enabled, restart the game and try again.


Now you can start sharing what you want to say or your music, be creative! :)
