# Features - Share your message!

- Create a custom list of sentences that you want to share with your friends and as long as you keep the option enabled, your list will be rotating automatically until you stop it.
You can also define the rotating change time limit starting from 10 seconds all up to a lot :)
- You can share your current song from Spotify with changes in real time as soon as your playlist plays or you skip the song.

## A lot more to share.
